Changelog
=========

This file follows most, but not all, of the conventions described at
[keepachangelog.com]. Especially we always use [ISO dates]. Subsections or
notations for changes may include Added, Changed, Deprecated, Fixed,
Removed, and Security.

Version numbers are [_major.minor.patch_][semver].

#### Unreleased

#### 0.3.0 2022-09-24
- Fixed: For Python 3.6, use a versioned `get-pip.py` instead of the default
  (latest) version. This probably changed when 3.6 was deprecated.
